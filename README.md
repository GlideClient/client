## License 
Glide uses [GPL v3](https://github.com/GlideClient/client/blob/main/LICENSE) which is a different license from [Soar](https://github.com/Soar-Client/Legacy-SoarClient), since some code within internal repo was incompatible with the [LGPL license](https://github.com/Soar-Client/Legacy-SoarClient/blob/main/LICENSE) of the [Soar repo](https://github.com/Soar-Client/Legacy-SoarClient) because of this if you want to use code under the [LGPL license](https://github.com/Soar-Client/Legacy-SoarClient/blob/main/LICENSE) you can take it from [Soar Client](https://github.com/Soar-Client/Legacy-SoarClient), not here

## Issues
Please either contact us on discord or make a GitHub issue if there are any issues that require our attention

## building (assuming intelij idea)
```
gradlew setupDecompWorkspace
```
```
gradlew genIntellijRuns
```
```
gradlew build
```

## Platform support
windows (working well) <br>
linux (working but some issues noticed that can be fixed by using the fps limit mod) <br>
mac os (not working, it is missing lwjgl 3 and nanovg natives for mac os)

## Future
I don't want glide to compete with [Soar Client](https://github.com/Soar-Client/Legacy-SoarClient) so when [Soar Client](https://github.com/Soar-Client/Legacy-SoarClient) V8 releases this project will be instantly archived
